## github-repo-complexity
I tried for the as much time i had till 19th date. The shown result is for just one repo and efforts are present in the file <b>"prompt langchain.ipynb"</b>.

Below conversation are from the repo "https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain".

====================================================

**Question**: From class hierarchy, which one is most complex?

**Answer**: The most complex class in the hierarchy is the `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` class, which is a subclass of both `BaseChatMemory` and `SummarizerMixin`. It inherits functionality from both parent classes and combines them to provide a memory that can store chat messages and generate summaries of the conversation. 


**Question**: Determine the cyclomatic complexity of the class 

**Answer**: The cyclomatic complexity of the class `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` is 7.
