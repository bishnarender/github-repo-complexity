## github-repo-complexity
The shown result is for just one repo and efforts are present in the file <b>"prompt langchain.ipynb"</b>.

Below conversation are with the repo "https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain".

====================================================

**Question**: From class hierarchy, which one is most complex?

**Answer**: The most complex class in the hierarchy is the `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` class, which is a subclass of both `BaseChatMemory` and `SummarizerMixin`. It inherits functionality from both parent classes and combines them to provide a memory that can store chat messages and generate summaries of the conversation. 


**Question**: Determine the cyclomatic complexity of the class 

**Answer**: The cyclomatic complexity of the class `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` is 7. 

====================================================

Cyclomatic complexity is the most preferred method to determine the complexity of any code. Likewise we can determine the complexity of all other repos and finally can choose the technically most complex one.
